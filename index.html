			<p>I began my career as a web designer driven by a passion for creating engaging and user-friendly web designs and applications. During my senior year of school, I started freelancing online, offering custom UI/UX design services to clients locally and internationally.

In my freelance roles, I focused on understanding client needs and delivering practical solutions. I specialized in developing effective landing pages that helped businesses increase conversions and creating website profiles that accurately represented company identities and goals. Additionally, I gained experience in developing HTML email templates that improved client communication strategies.

My approach combines creativity with a pragmatic understanding of client objectives, ensuring that each project meets functional requirements while aligning with client visions. I am committed to continuous learning and improvement in order to deliver valuable and effective web design solutions.</p>
